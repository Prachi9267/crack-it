                    <h4>Procedure</h4>
                    <h5>Round 1: Google Online Challenge</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The first round is a coding round where 2 questions will be given based on DSA.</li>
                        <li>Topics covered include stacks, binary search, and bit manipulation.The difficulty level can be LeetCode medium-hard with a time limit of 1 hour to solve both questions.</li>
                        <li>Participants were judged on their performance in the coding challenge alongside their individual profile screening through resumes.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Selected participants from Round 1 were divided into different learning cohorts.</li>
                        <li>These workshops are followed by a DSA coding round where participants solve 2 questions based on varied topics such as divide & conquer.The time limit is 1 hour and the difficulty is LeetCode medium-hard.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h5>Round 3: Ideathon Round</h5>

                        <li>The primary problem statement is subdivided into 3 themes, and participants are required to choose one and develop a solution for it.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h5>The Grand Finale: Presentation round</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>For the final presentation, participants create a presentation on Google Slides showcasing their idea along with a demo of the working prototype.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Tips:</strong> Keep practicing DSA and give contests to get a stronghold over it.Do not limit yourself to a particular stack; develop an attitude to solve problems through whatever means necessary.</p>
