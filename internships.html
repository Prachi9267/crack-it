                        <h4>Eligibility Criteria</h4>
                        <ul>
                        <p>The Ascend Educare Program is only for women in engineering and is not open to male students. The eligibility requirements are as follows:</p>
                             <li>second- and third-year female students of B.Tech/B.E. programs</li>
                             <li> Third- and fourth-year students in a five-year dual degree program</li>
                             <li>First-year students in a two-year M.Tech/MS/MCA program</li>
                             <li> Second-year students in a three-year MCA program</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Program Rounds</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Round 1: Resume Shortlisting</strong><br>
                                This is an elimination round, where your resume plays a crucial role. If your resume is shortlisted, you advance to Round 2.<br>
                                <strong>Tips:</strong> Do not write fake things in order to get the opportunity; highlight your skills and projects done till then.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Round 2: HackerRank Online Test</strong><br>
                                This test is taken on HackerRank with proctoring and comprises three sections. Section 1 is Aptitude, with medium-hard difficulty questions from probability, profit and loss, and quantitative aptitude. Section 2 is Computer Science Fundamentals, with questions on time complexity, DBMS, OOPs, and some bug-finding questions. Section 3 is Coding, with three medium-to-hard difficulty questions. One question was very tough, and students who completed even half of it were invited for further rounds.<br>
                                <strong>Tips:</strong> For coding questions, practicing on platforms like Leetcode can help build basic understanding and the problem-tackling approach.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Round 3: Technical and HR Interview</strong><br>
                                Only a few reach the interview stage, and this round lasts about 45 minutes. The interviewer may ask for an introduction, followed by medium-to-hard coding questions on topics like linked lists and graphs. The HR interview includes questions testing soft skills.<br>
                                <strong>Tips:</strong> Questions that can be asked in the HR or personal interview include "Introduce Yourself," "How do you plan to manage the workload of this program alongside your college studies?" and questions about handling difficult project situations or explaining technical concepts.
                            </li>
